This document explains the Structure of the Automated tests
 This Automated Tests are Built using Page Object Model Design with MSTest and Uses CommonComponents.dll(Main part of Framework) which can be used to Build Automated Tests across any Web Applications in the Organization
  I have used cnb.com website and Created 3 scenarios for Automation
   Mortgage Enquiry,HomePage Links 
  Solution used Project Dependencies - CommonComponents.dll - This uses Abstraction Principle
  BasePage is extended for Each Page Class - This uses Inheritance Principle
  All Page classes have Elements(Data) belong to that Page and Methods(Actions) performed using that Elemets on that Page - This uses Encapsulation Principle
  Test Method 2 and 3 in tests Uses Same method with different Paramters - This uses Polymorphism Principle
  
  I'm Using Runsettings file and config file per Environment to control and run the tests as needed - Runsettings file will upload config files .
  Advantage of Runsettings file is when we create Pipeline in Azure for this repos..we can overwrite config path in runsettings on fly and can be run on any environment with the same set of tests
  
  To Run the Tests - 
  I'm uploading Zip folder(Reports Folder) which has support files to run the tests. Unzip to a path and update the path in the Base Page
  Point the runsettings file to the path as well to pick the config
